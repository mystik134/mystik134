- 👋 Hi, I’m @mystik134
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, videogames, Japanese culture, tattoos, anime, programming (duh), MMORPGs, and being true to myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Japanese language + kanji, new ways to live, see, and exist.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects, computer music, animated music videos, and writing (books, screenplay, skits, anything really).
- 📫 How to reach me? alwworkemail@gmail.com
